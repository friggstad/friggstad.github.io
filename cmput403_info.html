        <h2>CMPUT 303/403 - Practical Algorithmics / Algorithmics in Competitive Programming</h2>

        <br>

        <p>
          <b>Disclaimer</b>: No part of this should be taken as official (i.e. part of the course outline).
          This is just an information page that is subject to change at any time and may
          disagree with a current offering of CMPUT 303/403.
          The information below is tailored to how I run the course. Other instructors run the course in a similar manner, but there may
          be deviations.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>What Are These Courses?</h3>

        <p>
          I frequently get asked what this course is about. The
          university calendar descriptions for <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue/course/cmput/303">CMPUT 303</a> and <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue/course/cmput/303">CMPUT 403</a> are a bit cryptic.
        </p>

        <p>
          These courses were born from an individual study in problem solving for programming contests.
          Initially only CMPUT 403 was offered and was, at first, taken only by members of the programming club.
          Then interest grew, in part due to the fact that many interviews
          have a problem solving component: the famous "interview questions". Others like this course because
          the myriad of coding assignments help develop
          experience with both coding and debugging (in addition to problem solving).
          So CMPUT 303 was introduced in Fall 2022 (under the course number CMPUT 398 for the first year only) 
          in order to provide a more accessible experience to students who do not have a programming contest background.
        </p>

        <p>
          This course retains the "individual study" feel in the following sense:
          lecture content is not as in-depth with particular topics as, say, CMPUT 304.
          Rather, you are pointed to information on various algorithms and problem solving paradigms
          and it is understood that you will adapt this information to help solve assignment problems.
          Topics are presented on a weekly basis: one week is dynamic programming, one is graph algorithms, etc.
          Lectures spend some time introducing a topic and related algorithms/data structures but are mostly spent
          discussing solutions to related sample problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are encouraged to also attend our <a href="https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~uapsc/">Programming Club</a>
          meetings where similar problems are discussed, but this is not required.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Nature of the Course Work</h3>

        <p>
          Primarily, you will be solving problems. This means you read a description,
          design an efficient algorithm to solve the problem, implement it,
          and have it <font color="green"><b>ACCEPTED</b></font> by an automated judging platform that tests your solution
          on some hidden data (that conforms to the problem specification).
        </p>

        <p>
          If you don't know what that means, go to <a href="https://open.kattis.com/" target="_blank">Open Kattis</a>,
          create an account, and try to solve some very easy problems. You can sort the problems by difficulty by clicking on the column header on the Problems page. Make sure you "submit" your solution
          to see the judgement. Notice: it is <b>all or nothing</b>. If you don't pass all test cases, it is not "accepted".
        </p>

        <p>
          You will do this time after time after time in CMPUT 303/403 on a Kattis site tailored for U of A courses. There will be weekly problem sets consisting usually of 3-4 problems,
          the first week is an exception because you solve more (6 or 7) but most are on the easy side. If you get a problem "accepted" before the deadline, you get full marks.
          There are no partial marks for an incorrect solution.
          Some problems are scored in that Kattis gives partial credit for solving some data sets, but in CMPUT 303/403 you will get 0% unless you solve all data sets in which case you get 100%.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have 2 weeks to complete each problem set and a new set is released each week, which means in general there are 2 active problem sets at any given time.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>CMPUT 303 / 403 Differences</h3>
        <p>
          The primary differences are the following:
          <ul>
            <li>CMPUT 303 students grades are based only on weekly assignments and an <i>open pool</i> of problems presented without context like in a contest (e.g. you have to decide what problem solving strategy to use). CMPUT 403 students will do this as well plus an additional project or task (details TBD).</li>
            <li>The assignments have many problems in common between CMPUT 303 and CMPUT 403.
              Usually (not always), the main difference is that the hardest problem in CMPUT 403 does not appear on the
              CMPUT 303 set and the easiest problem on the CMPUT 303 set does not appear on the CMPUT 403 set.
            </li>
            <li>Later in the course, some advanced topics do not appear on a CMPUT 303 assignment (for example, maximum flow or the fast Fourier transform).</li>
            <li>CMPUT 403 students will solve a few more problems in total.</li>
          </ul>

          <b>Should I take 303 or 403?</b>
          <p>
            CMPUT 403 is considerably more work intensive. Even though weekly assignments (often) differ in only one problem between 303/403, the harder problem can take quit a bit more time to solve.
            CMPUT 403 is recommended only for those with a background in competitive programming and are interested in broadening their range of problem solving strategies.
            Students who do not have a background in competitive programming are encouraged to take CMPUT 303.
            Only some students in CMPUT 303 are active members
            of the programming club. You will be among the significant majority in CMPUT 303 if you do not have this background.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Caution</b>: Some students may be interested in taking CMPUT 403 even though they do not have much competitive programming experience.
            For example, perhaps this course is helping you fulfil 4th year course requirements. This is strongly discouraged. You might want to consider different 400-level CMPUT course to fulfil your 4th-year course requirements.
          </p>
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Programming Language</h3>
        <p>
          There are 2 facets to this topic:
          <ul>
            <li>The official language of <b>instruction</b> is C++.
              That is, all code I present during the lectures and post to eClass will be written in C++.
              I prefer C++ because it strikes the right balance between
              efficiency and versatility. It is usually as fast or nearly as fast as C or other lower-level languages,
              but the standard template library in C++ contains many indispensible data structures and algorithms not available
              in the standard library of C.</li>
            <li>You may still solve problems in any language supported by <a href="https://open.kattis.com/" target="_blank">Open Kattis</a> which includes Python3 and Java.<br><br>
              <b>Caveats</b>: Python3 typically runs 2x - 3x slower than C++. The site uses the Python3 interpreter pypy3 which is usually
              more efficient than cpython, but still slower than C++. In some cases, it can run much slower than C++; I have seen running times of 15x slower than C++ even though the implementations look identical apart from
              the obvious language differences. Java is also noticeably slower than C++.
              All problems issued in CMPUT 303/403 can be solved by Python or Java. But occasionally there are problems that are frustrating to solve in these languages.
              You can always view the statistics page for a problem to see how successful Python or Java submissions tend to be (eg. <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/minibattleship/statistics">this page for the problem Mini Battleship</a>).<br>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To get the most learning out of this course, I encourage you to use C++.
            It is not required, many students succeed just using Python or Java.
            But learning to use C++ effectively will expand your coding abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to practice C++ beforehand, I recommend you learn how to use
            the data structures and algorithms in the Standard Template Library.
            For example: linked lists, queues, vectors, priority_queue, set, map,
            unordered_set, unordered_map, and the sort() function. Spend time getting
            used to iterators in the STL. Also, get used to the I/O streaming model
            used in C++ (eg. cin and cout) as it is quite different
            than the line-by-line input approach taken by Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>No direct instruction in C++ will be provided</b> apart from incidental
            comments and occasional tips. This is why CMPUT 201 is a prerequisite, students
            who learned C well in this course will find little trouble adapting to C++.
          </p>
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          The formal prerequisites for CMPUT 303 are CMPUT (175 or 201) and CMPUT 204.
          The reason for CMPUT 175/201 is so that you have already been introduced to C. CMPUT 175 currently
          teaches C++ but CMPUT 201 does not. Still, in CMPUT 303/403 we won't use advanced features of C++:
          it will mainly be C with classes and templates and some of the simpler features of new C++ standards like
          range-based for loops. So students who have a strong grasp of C should have no problem quickly adapting to C++.
          CMPUT 204 is required so that you have already seen many of the algorithmic concepts, e.g. heaps, graph searches, dynamic programming, etc.
          But on a higher level, CMPUT 204 is required so that you know how to understand a written description of an algorithm
          and running time analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          CMPUT 403 additionally requires a 300-level CMPUT course. This is mainly to ensure you have sufficient experience
          in the field of Computing Science. Ideally I would also add that students should have sufficient exposure to competitive programming
          either through actively participating in our club or in contests like the ICPC (or even past contests like Google's now-retired CodeJam).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some algorithms used in this course are taught in CMPUT 304, but you can pick them up during the readings.
          For example, students who have not taken CMPUT 304 tend to spend extra time learning about <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/edmonds_karp.html">network flow</a>
          and <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/kuhn_maximum_bipartite_matching.html">bipartite matching</a>, so you can read up on these topics ahead of time if you wish.
          They will appear in the latter half of the course. You will only be required to know how to use existing implementations of them and understand how their running times affect the overall running time of your solution to a problem,
          you don't have to implement them yourselves
          or provide proofs of correctness/running time.
        </p>
        <p>
          While no MATH course is strictly required, mathematical thinking will be used at times:
          <ul>
            <li>Solving a system of equations: Gaussian Elimination.</li>
            <li>Matrices, especially multiplication.</li>
            <li>Basics of modular arithmetic. You should know what "arithmetic mod m" means where m is a positive integer.
              <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/module-inverse.html">Modular inverses</a> are discussed as well
              (we will discuss the method using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm).</li>
            <li>The basics of prime numbers and prime factorization. Nothing too in-depth.</li>
            <li>Basic geometry, it is all elementary (eg. how to represent the line between 2 points,
              how to compute the intersection points of 2 circles, etc.).</li>
            <li>Dot products and cross products in 2D: simple applications.</li>
            <li>There are other small topics, but this should give you an idea of what we will see.</li>
          </ul>
          In some sense, everything we do as problem solvers is "math". I suppose I am just giving an impression
          of topics that typically do not appear in our algorithms courses.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Textbook</h3>
        <p>
          There is no required textbook, but there is a highly-suggested book:
          <a href="https://cpbook.net/details?cp=4">Competitive Programming 4</a>.
          I recommend both "books" so you get all of Chapters 1 - 9. The sequence of topics in
          CMPUT 303/403 loosely follows this book for most of the course and the book contains excellent additional
          problem suggestions from a spectrum of difficulties.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bookstore will adopt this book, but you might want to consider ordering it on
          your own as there is a significant markup in price.
          Expect a few weeks for shipping. The electronic version is perfectly acceptable.
          Again, I don't lecture directly out of the book it is just a good guide for how to think about various weekly topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are interested in the book, I strongly recommend the 4th edition.
          The 3rd edition will not be quite as nice. A few new topics appear in the 4th edition
          and they expanded the list of suggested problems to include problems from
          <a href="https://open.kattis.com/">Kattis</a>, which will be the platform used
          in CMPUT 403. Kattis problems were not included in the 3rd edition of the book.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Is This Course Right For You?</h3>
        <p>
          Be prepared to spend many, <b>many</b> hours coding and debugging each week.
        </p>
        <p>
          The topics in this course change rapidly. One week, you are solving geometry problems.
          Then the next week, you might be solving problems in combinatorics. Then string algorithms.
          Then graph algorithms. Then data structures.
          This can be jarring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Are you self-motivated to read up on topics you might not be familiar with? You will do this a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want a more hands-on impression of the sort of problems we will encounter,
          here are a few samples along with my opinion on their
          difficulty compared with the average problems issued in CMPUT 303.
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/delimitersoup">Delimiter Soup</a> (very easy)</li>
            <li><a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/froshweek2">Frosh Week 2</a> (easy)</li>
            <li><a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/importspaghetti">Import Spaghetti</a> (normal, graph algorithm)</li>
            <li><a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/spiderman">Spiderman's Workout</a> (normal, dynamic programming)</li>
          </ul>
          Don't just solve these in your head: implement them and get them accepted on the online judge! For example, "Import Spaghetti" is
          not so hard conceptually but you have to get a few implementation details just right in order to have it accepted.
          Working through these will give you a very strong impression of the sort of work you can expect in this course.
        </p>

        <p>
